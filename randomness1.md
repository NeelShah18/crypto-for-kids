**Goal: Explain why randomness is important for crypto.**

This is a placeholder. No good ideas yet.

The thing is a natural follow-up to OTP (if the pad is not fully random, the encryption is weak), but that may be too complex.

Alternative: Rock-paper-scissors game. The game is perfectly fair as long as participants act randomly. If they do not, it's easy to win.
