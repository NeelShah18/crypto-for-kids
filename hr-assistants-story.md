### HR assistant's story

X's works in recruitement and his work is assess other people's foreign language skills. What he typically does is that he asks the applicant to translate some radomly chosen words from Enlish to Spanish. He says: "Dog", the applicant replies "Perro". He says: "Cat", the applicant replies "Gato". After twenty or so such questions he's reasonably sure that the applicant speaks Spanish.

After doing this work for 40 years, X is about to retire and he's training his assistant to replace him in time. They meet the applicant, the assistent asks the questions (Dog, Cat etc.) and the applicant replies correctly (Perro, Gato etc.) X approves the applicant as beig fluent in Spanish.

Later on, the company that hired the applicant complains that the guy doesn't speak Spanish at all. What happened?
