**Simple 1-bit example of OTP. Shows how the true content of the message cannot be given away.**

Imagine two armies preparing for a battle.

The general of one of them sees two possibilities. The enemy can attack either on the left wing or on the right wing.

Soon, an enemy messenger is caught, carrying a note saying:

    Attack on the left wing!
    Attack on the right wing!

When interrogated, he explains that the code is that the first sentence should be ignored and the second one should be followed.

The messenger feels no loyalty to his army and is actually telling the truth.

However, the general realizes that he may be lying. The code may really have been that the first sentence is correct, while the second one false.

He orders messenger to be tortured.

The messenger has no intention to suffer to win someone else's war. At the same time it's clear that if he continues to tell truth he will be tortured. So he says that general is right and it's the first sentence that should be taken into account.

The general begins to feel a bit uneasy at this point. He has two contradictory confessions and it's not at all clear which one is correct.

He orders the torture to proceed only to make the messager change his confession once again.

The general has a revelation and says: "This day I understood that there are secrets you cannot give away. You cannot give them away to save yourself from torture. You cannot give them awat to save your kids from being sold to slavery. You cannot give them away to prevent the end of the world. You cannot give them away and whether you want to or not matters little."
