** Explain how to hide things in plain sight.**

### Steganography

Trithemius was an interesting character. Maybe we can make him a protagonist. Invocation of angels etc.

Speaking of magic, Fulcanelli with his Le Mystère des Cathédrales comes to mind as well.

And the chapter should definitely have a steganographic message hiddin in it. A message that would result if you took only uppercase letters should be relatively easy to write.
