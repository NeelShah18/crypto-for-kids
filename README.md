# Crypto for Kids

This project is a dumping ground for texts that will one day form a cryptography book for kids.

The goal of the book is to avoid as much technical detail as possible and focus on basic principles and the kind of thinking needed for crypto.

If you want to participate in writing the book, please drop me a note at sustrik@250bpm.com or simply open a pull request.
