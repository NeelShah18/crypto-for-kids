The story takes place in Borges' library of Babylon.

It may be about a person searching for a book that would precisely describe their life.

The idea here is that speculating about number of zeroes in the number or about number of atoms in the universe is not helping. Reader simply doesn't have the reference frame. They have no personal experience with number of atoms in the galaxy.

The idea of "all possible books" is more personal, especially, when you realize the library contains a book that thruthfuly describes your death.

Now apply that to cryptography: If the key is 4096 bits long, it's 512 letters. Long enough that your adversaries key may be a brief but exact description of your death.

"One of the books contained an eccentric description of an universe that was completely empty, witch no staircases or bookshelves, only with little ball-shaped pieces of debris that people lived on."
